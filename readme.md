# Portfolio Website – How Everything Works

Welcome to the source code and documentation for my interactive portfolio website! This README explains in detail how each section works, how the files are organized, and how you can customize or extend the project.

---

## 🏠 Home Page
The home page (`index.html`) is the entry point. It loads all sections (skills, projects, certifications, experience, contact) as different HTML blocks. Navigation is handled by anchor links in the header, allowing smooth scrolling to each section.

**How it works:**
- The header contains navigation links that use HTML anchors (e.g., `#skills`, `#projects`).
- CSS (`header.css`, `global.css`) ensures the header is sticky and responsive.
- The home section introduces you with a profile image, name, and a short tagline.

## � Skills Section
Located in the `#skills` section of `index.html`, this part visually displays your technical skills using icons (SVGs in `assets/images/skills/`).

**How it works:**
- Each skill is represented by an icon and a label.
- The layout is styled with `skills.css` for a grid or flexbox arrangement.
- You can add/remove skills by editing the HTML and updating the images folder.

## 🖼 Projects Gallery
The `#projects` section showcases your projects with images and descriptions.

**How it works:**
- Each project is a card with a thumbnail (`assets/images/projects/`), title, and short description.
- Clicking a project can open a modal or link to a live demo/source code.
- Styles are managed by `projects.css`.
- Add new projects by editing the HTML and placing images in the correct folder.

## 📜 Certifications
The `#certifications` section displays your certificates as a gallery.

**How it works:**
- Each certificate is shown as an image (`assets/images/certifications/`) with a caption.
- The layout uses `certifications.css` for a neat grid.
- Add new certificates by updating the HTML and images folder.

## 💼 Experience
The `#experience` section lists your professional and academic experiences.

**How it works:**
- Each experience is a card or timeline entry with role, organization, and duration.
- Styled by `experience.css`.
- Update the HTML to add or edit experiences.

## 📞 Contact Form
The `#contact` section provides a form for visitors to send you messages.

**How it works:**
- The form collects name, email, and message.
- Basic validation is handled in `index.js`.
- You can connect the form to an email service or backend for real submissions (currently static/demo).
- Styled by `contact.css`.

## 🤖 Custom Chatbot
An interactive chatbot is included for quick queries.

**How it works:**
- The chatbot UI is in the HTML, styled by `chatbot.css`.
- All logic is in `assets/js/index.js` (open/close, send/receive messages, simple responses).
- You can expand the chatbot logic for more advanced features.

## � Responsive Design
All sections are fully responsive.

**How it works:**
- Media queries in each CSS file ensure layouts adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Images and grids resize automatically.

## ⚙️ How to Run & Customize

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ZeeshanMalik9/Porfolio-Live.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```
   cd Porfolio-Live/portfolioFinalFiles
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
   - No build step required; all files are static.

**To customize:**
- Edit `index.html` to update content, sections, and links.
- Replace images in `assets/images/` to personalize skills, projects, etc.
- Edit CSS files in `assets/css/` to change styles, colors, or layout.
- Update `index.js` to add new interactivity or chatbot features.

## 🧑‍� How Each File Works

- **index.html:** Contains all the HTML for every section. Uses semantic tags and IDs for navigation.
- **assets/css/global.css:** Base styles, resets, and variables.
- **Section CSS files:** Each section (skills, projects, etc.) has its own CSS for modular styling.
- **assets/js/index.js:** Handles all JavaScript, including chatbot logic, form validation, and UI interactivity.
- **assets/images/:** All images for the site, organized by type.
